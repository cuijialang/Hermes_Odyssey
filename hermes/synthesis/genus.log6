        : Hierarchical instances can be automatically ungrouped to allow for better area or timing optimization. You can control auto ungrouping using the root-level attribute 'auto_ungroup'. You can skip individual instances or modules using the attribute 'ungroup_ok'.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.
