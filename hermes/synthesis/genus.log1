Info    : Deleting sequential instances not driving any primary outputs. [GLO-32]
        : Deleting 4 sequential instances. 
Following instances are deleted as they do not drive any primary output:
'SwitchControl/auxfree_reg[1]', 'SwitchControl/mux_out_reg[1][0]', 
'SwitchControl/mux_out_reg[1][1]', 'SwitchControl/mux_out_reg[1][2]'.
        : Optimizations such as constant propagation or redundancy removal could change the connections so an instance does not drive any primary outputs anymore. To see the list of deleted sequential, set the 'information_level' attribute to 2 or above. If the message is truncated set the message attribute 'truncate' to false to see the complete list.
Info    : Hierarchical instance automatically ungrouped. [GLO-51]
        : Instance 'CrossBar' in module 'Router' would be automatically ungrouped.
        : Hierarchical instances can be automatically ungrouped to allow for better area or timing optimization. You can control auto ungrouping using the root-level attribute 'auto_ungroup'. You can skip individual instances or modules using the attribute 'ungroup_ok'.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.
